I build websites with react and really only that(what can I say I know a great tool when I see one). I will use anything to build though if its better and helps me get the job done faster! I really want to get into the deep end of writing software though and for me that means get a cs degree for the math mainly but also because I want to know the fundamentals down to the bits and bytes of it all.
